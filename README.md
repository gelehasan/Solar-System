# Solar-System

The Solar System Simulation is a project made with p5.js that shows how planets move around a pretend sun. 
It's like a small model of our solar system on your computer screen. You can see the sun, Earth, two moons, and even a planet going around one of the moons. 
They change colors as they move. You can also change the size of the canvas and play with it. 
This project is a simple and enjoyable way to learn about how things move in space.
